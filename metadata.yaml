description: "Mr Standfast is the third of five Richard Hannay novels by John Buchan,\
  \ first published in 1919 by Hodder & Stoughton, London.\nIt is one of two Hannay\
  \ novels set during the First World War, the other being Greenmantle (1916); Hannay's\
  \ first and best-known adventure, The Thirty-Nine Steps (1915), is set in the period\
  \ immediately before the war started.\nThe title refers to a character in John Bunyan's\
  \ Pilgrim's Progress, to which there are many other references in the novel; Hannay\
  \ uses a copy of Pilgrim's Progress to decipher coded messages from his contacts,\
  \ and letters from his friend Peter Pienaar.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
